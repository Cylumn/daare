## <a name="about"></a>About
The Denoising Autoencoder for Auroral Radio Emissions (DAARE) 
is a tool to remove Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) commonly emerging
as horizontal emission lines from time-frequency spectrograms. This tool was
built to denoise Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR) observations from
the South Pole Station.

This work was generously supported by National Science Foundation 
grant AST-1950348 and conducted at the MIT Haystack Observatory REU 2022 by
Allen Chang and was advised by Mary Knapp.
